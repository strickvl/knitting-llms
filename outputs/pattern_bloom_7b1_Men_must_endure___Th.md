- Weave in ends as you go to minimize finishing work
- Block your finished piece to even out the stitches
- Take a picture of each row as you complete it to track your progress
- Consider using bobbins for each color to prevent tangling
- Remember that even-numbered rows are worked from left to right (wrong side)
